#### What is SQL
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- SQL lets you access and manipulate databases

##### what can SQL do
- SQL can execute CRUD operations on a database
- SQ

##### SQL is a standard...but
>Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.
However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

##### Using SQL in Your Web Site
To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
To use SQL to get the data you want
To use HTML / CSS to style the page

#### RDBMS
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System

RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.


##### SQL Statements
Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.

The following SQL statement selects all the records in the "Customers" table:

Example
```
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

### Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
- SELECT - extracts data from a database
- UPDATE - updates data in a database
- DELETE - deletes data from a database
- INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
- CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
- ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
- CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
- ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
- DROP TABLE - deletes a table
- CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
- DROP INDEX - deletes an index

### Why use SQL
##### 1. Faster query processing -
large amount of data is retrieved quickly and efficiently. operations like insertions, deletion, manipulation of data is also done in almost no time
##### 2. No Coding Skills –
For data retrieval, large number of lines of code is not required. All basic keywords such as SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, etc are used and also the syntactical rules are not complex in SQL, which makes it a user-friendly language.
##### 3.Standardised Language –
Due to documentation and long establishment over years, it provides a uniform platform worldwide to all its users.
##### 4.Portable –
It can be used in programs in PCs, server, laptops independent of any platform (Operating System, etc). Also, it can be embedded with other applications as per need/requirement/use.
##### 5.Interactive Language –
Easy to learn and understand, answers to complex queries can be received in seconds.
##### 6.Multiple data views
Using the SQL language, the users can make different views of the database structure.
