> Picking the right architecture = Picking the right battles + Managing trade-offs

>there was no objective way to define what was fundamental, or high level and that a better view of architecture was  **the shared understanding that the expert developers have of the system design.**
A second common style of definition for architecture is that it's “the design decisions that need to be made early in a project”, but Ralph complained about this too, saying that it was more like  **the decisions you wish you could get right early in a project**. His conclusion was that  **“Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is”**
