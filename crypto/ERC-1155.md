# ERC-1155

is a standard that allows the creation of fungible, semi-fungible and non-fungible tokens all in the same standard. Can be viewed as a hybrid of the ERC-20(fungible) and ERC-721(non-fungible). Tying together these can have significant benefits. 
- it can make code more concise and simple as you don't need to have deal with two different currency standards, have single smart contract that can aggregate multiple transactions all in the same standard vs 2. This can streamline user experience and developer complexity
